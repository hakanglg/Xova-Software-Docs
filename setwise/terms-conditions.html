        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="overview">
            <h2 id="overview" class="section">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Setwise app ("Application") created by Hakan GÖLGE ("Service Provider") as a Free service.</p>
            <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to the terms outlined below. Unauthorized copying, modification, or reverse engineering of any part of the Application or trademarks is strictly prohibited. All related intellectual property remains the property of the Service Provider.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="modifications">
            <h2 id="modifications" class="section">2. Service Modifications</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider reserves the right to modify the Application or introduce charges at any time. Any such changes will be clearly communicated in advance.</p>
            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data you have provided in order to deliver the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. Jailbreaking or rooting your device is strongly discouraged as it may compromise functionality and security.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="third-party">
            <h2 id="third-party" class="section">3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>The Application uses third-party services with their own terms. Please review them:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a></li>

        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="connectivity">
            <h2 id="connectivity" class="section">4. Connectivity & Device Requirements</h2>
            <p>Some app features require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
            <p>If you are using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. You may incur charges for data usage, including roaming data charges if used outside of your home territory. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges.</p>
            <p>Keeping your device charged is your responsibility. The Service Provider is not liable for service inaccessibility due to battery failure.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="liability">
            <h2 id="liability" class="section">5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>While the Service Provider strives to ensure that the Application is updated and accurate at all times, they rely on third parties to provide information. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the Application.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="updates">
            <h2 id="updates" class="section">6. Updates & Service Termination</h2>
            <p>The Application may require updates. You agree to always accept updates when offered. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you.</p>
            <p>Upon any termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the Application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="changes">
            <h2 id="changes" class="section">7. Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>These terms may be updated periodically. Please review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
